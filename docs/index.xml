This section explains how to make authenticated HTTP Requests to Fider. The first step is to generate an API Key on your user profile. Sign in on Fider and navigate to Settings - API Key and click on Regenerate API Key. An API Key will be shown. Take note of it as you won&#39;t be able to retrieve this key again. If your Key is lost or has been compromised, you can always repeat this process to generate a new Key.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://getfider.com/docs/api/best-practices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://getfider.com/docs/api/best-practices/</guid><description>Best Practices Service Account A common approach when using Fider API is to sign in with a generic email address (like `admin@yourcompany.com`), then switch to an Administrator user and promote the new user to an Administrator as well. This allows you to use a common user account on all API operations, without having to use a personal user account. How to properly use impersonation We usually recommend the usage of impersonation in combination with the Create User API.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://getfider.com/docs/api/comments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://getfider.com/docs/api/comments/</guid><description>Comments List Comments Get a Comment Add a Comment Edit a Comment Delete a Comment List Comments - Authentication: Optional ``` GET /api/v1/posts/{number}/comments ``` Parameters Name Type Description number number Required.

The Fider API allows you to manage Posts and other data within your Fider instance in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests. The endpoints are intuitive and powerful, allowing you to easily make calls to retrieve information or to execute actions.
Version
The API v1 was introduced on Fider v0.16.0. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re running the latest version of Fider to leverage the API.</description></item><item><title>Configuring OAuth</title><link>https://getfider.com/docs/configuring-oauth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://getfider.com/docs/configuring-oauth/</guid><description>OAuth is an open standard for authentication and authorization.

To overcome this situation, Fider can be configured to use rendergun, a service that prerender pages on the server and return HTML responses for crawler requests.
To learn more about rendergun, read this blog post.
To configure rendergun, add another service to your docker-compose.</description></item><item><title>Hosting an instance on Heroku</title><link>https://getfider.com/docs/hosting-on-heroku/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://getfider.com/docs/hosting-on-heroku/</guid><description>Prerequisites A Heroku account It&#39;s totally free to sign up, and will allow you to deploy your application for free on a small instance.
