### 1. Redesign

The goal of this redesign was a default theme that could be easily used any customer, without forcing the violet theme.
We've also removed the focus from the vote counter to the content, while keeping it simple and clean.

- Letter avatar for those who doesn't have a [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) profile;
- Beautiful 404 and 500 pages;
- Built with the latest and greatest `Go 1.9`;

### How to update

Running an old Fider version? Don't worry, the upgrade process is just a matter of updating your Docker container to the latest stable image on Docker Hub. Use <code>getfider/fider:stable</code> to make sure you're always running the stable version.
