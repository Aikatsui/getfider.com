Fider is client-side rendered, which means that some search engines (such as Google or Bing), might delay or not even crawl Fider very often, which is far from ideal for a public website.

To overcome this situation, Fider can be configured to use rendergun, a service that prerender pages on the server and return HTML responses for crawler requests.

To learn more about [rendergun](https://github.com/goenning/rendergun), read this [blog post](https://goenning.net/2019/11/05/seo-on-spa-apps-with-rendergun/).

To configure rendergun, add another service to your docker-compose.yml and link it on your fider app service, just like the following.

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  rendergun:
    restart: always
    image: goenning/rendergun

  app:
    image: getfider/fider:stable
    ...
    environment:
      RENDERGUN_URL: http://rendergun:3000
    depends_on:
      - db
      - rendergun
```

To test that everything is working as it should, using your favorite HTTP client tool (like Postman or cURL), send a request to `http://localhost:9999` with a `User-Agent: Googlebot/2.1` header value. The response from Fider should be a HTML without links to JavaScript files. When removing the User-Agent header, the response is then a few empty div elements and links to JavaScript files.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

Google (and other search engines) will now crawl and index your Fider website just like any other website.
