### Prerequisites

To configure HTTPS, you'll need a `Certificate` file and a `Private Key` file. You can either buy it or generate one with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

### How to enable it

These are the two environment variables that have to be defined.

1. <b>SSL_CERT</b>: The name of the `Certificate` file.
2. <b>SSL_CERT_KEY</b>: The name of the `Private Key` file.

Fider's Docker image expects both file to be available on `/app/etc`. You can copy these files anywhere you want on your server and share them with your Docker container by using [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).

For example, if your files are inside `/home/me/fider`, you can map it to the container with `-v /home/me/fider:/app/etc`
